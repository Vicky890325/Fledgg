containing Fledgg plugins that load in your browser may be communicated to us. Further, by importing 
any of your Fledgg data through the Fledgg Application, you represent that you have authority to share
the transferred data with your mobile carrier or other access provider. In the event you change or 
deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your Fledgg account information to ensure 
that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your 
responsibility. You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related

articles and other information. However, Fledgg, in its sole discretion, remove content from anywhere 
on the Services if the content violates this Agreement or others’ intellectual property rights. Please note 
that ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Members or, if public, by 
Visitors, and Fledgg cannot guarantee that other Members will or will not use the ideas and 
information that you share on Fledgg, nor the manner of use. Therefore, if you have an idea or 
information that you would like to keep confidential or don’t want others to use, or that is subject to 
third party rights that may be infringed by your sharing it, do not post it on Fledgg. FLEDGG IS NOT

information gathered from Fledgg commercially unless expressly authorized by Fledgg) is strictly 
prohibited and a violation of this Agreement. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in this 
Agreement, including, without limitation, title, ownership, intellectual property rights, and all other 
rights and interest in Fledgg and all related items, including any and all copies made of the Fledgg

doubt, Fledgg has no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content that you or 
other Members provide when using the Services. Fledgg may be required by local laws to remove 
certain information or content and so that information or content may not be available on our Service in 
those countries. </div>

		<div class="mini-title">4.2. Third Party Content, Sites and Developers </div>
	<div class="small-text"><strong>Your access of other Members’ and third parties’ content and information posted on 
the Services is at your own risk. </strong><br>By using the Services, you may be exposed to other Members’ or third party content or information

not responsible for these third-party activities. </strong><br>Fledgg may include links to third party web sites (“Third Party Sites”) on our Services. Fledgg also 
enables third party developers (“Platform Developers”) to create applications (“Platform 
Applications”) that provide features and functionality using data and developer tools made available by 
Fledgg through its developer platform. You are responsible for evaluating whether you want to access or use a Third Party Site or Platform Application. You should review any applicable terms or privacy 
policy of a Third Party Site or Platform Application before using it or sharing any information with it, 
because you may give the third-party permission to use your information in ways we would not. Fledgg 
is not responsible for and does not endorse any features, content, advertising, products or other 
materials on or available from Third Party Sites or Platform Applications. Fledgg also does not screen, 
audit, or endorse Platform Applications. Accordingly, if you decide to use Third Party Sites or use 
Platform Applications, you do so at your own risk and agree that your use of any Platform Application 
is on an “as-is” basis without any warranty as to the Platform Developer’s actions, and that this 
Agreement does not apply to your use of any Third Party Site or Developer Application. Please note: If
you allow a Platform Application or Third Party Site to authenticate you or connect with your Fledgg 
account, that application or website can access information on Fledgg related to you and your 
connections. For additional information regarding Platform Developers and Platform Applications, 
please refer to Fledgg’s Privacy Policy. </div>

<div class="mini-title">4.3. Disclosure of User Information </div>

Privacy Policy. </strong><br>You acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve, and disclose your registration and 
any other information you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy if required to do
so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary in 
our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal 
subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to 
claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a Member, 
individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, 
property, or personal safety of Fledgg, our Members or the public. Disclosures of Member information 
to third parties other than those required to provide customer support, administer this agreement, or

your account if Fledgg determines, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary to enforce this 
Agreement. </div>

	<div class="mini-title">4.5. Intellectual Property Notices</div>
	<div class="small-text"><strong>We are providing you notice about our intellectual property rights. </strong><br>The Services include the copyrights and Intellectual property rights of Fledgg and except for the

	<div class="sub-title">6. Limitation of Liability </div>

	<div class="small-text"><strong>We are trying to limit any legal liability we may have to you.</strong><br>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR 
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE 
CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither Fledgg nor any of our 
subsidiaries, affiliated companies, suppliers, employees, shareholders, or directors (“Fledgg Affiliates”) 
shall be cumulatively liable for (a) any damages in excess of five times the most recent monthly fee 
that you paid for a Premium Service, if any, or US $100, whichever amount is greater, or (b) any 
special, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, profit, revenue or data to 
you or any third person arising from your use of the Services, any Platform Applications or any of the
content or other materials on, accessed through or downloaded from Fledgg. This limitation of liability 
is part of the basis of the bargain between the parties and without it the terms and prices charged would 
be different. This limitation of liability shall: <br><br>

Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute 
or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies provided in this 
section fail of their essential purpose; and 
<br><br> Not apply to any damage that Fledgg may cause you intentionally or 
knowingly in violation of this Agreement or applicable law, or as otherwise 
mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed in this Agreement. 
<br><br> Not apply if you have entered into a separate agreement to purchase Premium 
Services with a separate Limitation of Liability provision that supersedes this 
section in relation to those Premium Services.

commercially without Fledgg’s authorization, infringing any intellectual property rights, violating any 
of the Do’s and Don’ts listed in Section 10, or any other behavior that Fledgg, in its sole discretion,

award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost 
effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects 
arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution 
(“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply 
with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely
based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; 
(b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless 
otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
